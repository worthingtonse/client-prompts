### **Function Specification: isPathOnRemovableStorage**

#### **1\. Function Purpose**

The primary purpose of this function is to enhance data security by verifying that a given file path is located on a removable storage device (such as a USB flash drive, external SSD, or SD card). This allows an application to ensure that sensitive data can be physically disconnected and secured from network-based threats.

#### **2\. Function Signature**

function isPathOnRemovableStorage(filePath: string): boolean

* **Function Name:** isPathOnRemovableStorage  
* **Input Parameter:**  
  * filePath (string): A string representing the absolute or relative path to a file or directory.  
* **Return Value:**  
  * (boolean): Returns true if the path resides on a device identified as removable. Returns false if the path resides on a fixed (internal) drive or if an error occurs.

#### **3\. Detailed Logic & Platform Considerations**

The core logic involves querying the host operating system to determine the properties of the physical drive associated with the given filePath. **This function is inherently platform-dependent**, and its implementation must be adapted for different operating systems.

1. **Normalize and Resolve Path:**  
   * Take the input filePath and resolve it to an absolute path.  
   * Identify the root mount point or drive letter of the path (e.g., C:\\ on Windows, / or /mnt/data on Linux, /Volumes/MyUSB on macOS).  
2. **Query Drive Type (Platform-Specific):**  
   * **On Windows:**  
     * **Primary Method:** Use the GetDriveType Win32 API function on the resolved drive letter. The function should return true if the type is DRIVE\_REMOVABLE.  
     * **Alternative Method:** Query the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. Check the Win32\_LogicalDisk class for the DriveType property, where a value of 2 indicates a removable disk.  
   * **On macOS:**  
     * **Primary Method:** Execute the command-line tool diskutil info for the volume associated with the path. Parse the output to find the key Removable Media. The function should return true if its value is Yes.  
   * **On Linux:**  
     * **Primary Method:** Identify the block device for the given path (e.g., /dev/sda1). Check the value in the corresponding sysfs file: /sys/block/\<device\>/removable. If the file contains the character 1, the device is removable.  
     * **Alternative Method:** Execute the command-line tool lsblk \-d \-o name,rm. Parse the output to find the device and check if its RM (Removable) column value is 1\.  
3. **Return Result:**  
   * If the OS query successfully identifies the device as removable, the function must return true.  
   * If the device is identified as fixed, or if the path is invalid, or if any OS-level command or API call fails, the function must return false.

#### **4\. Error Handling**

* The function must be robust and not throw exceptions for common issues.  
* It should gracefully handle invalid or non-existent paths by returning false.  
* Any errors encountered while executing system commands or calling OS APIs should be caught internally, and the function should return false.

#### **5\. Code Requirements**

* **Documentation:** The function definition should be preceded by a documentation block (e.g., JSDoc, Python Docstring) that explains its purpose, its platform-dependent nature, its parameters, and what true and false represent.  
* **Comments:** The code should contain comments that clearly identify the platform-specific blocks of logic (e.g., // Windows-specific implementation).  
* **Variable Naming:** Use clear and descriptive variable names (e.g., isRemovable, drivePath, osCommandOutput).

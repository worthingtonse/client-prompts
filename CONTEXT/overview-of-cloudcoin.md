# Introduction to Raida-Based Token Protocol

## The goals of the raida based Token are to be:
* The fastest token in the world and complete transactions in less than half a second. 
* The most scalable token in the world and will handle all the transactions it is given. 
* The most energy efficient token in the world and will use less electricity than a house.
* The most private token in the world with no user accounts, passwords and user-identifying information.
* The most legal token in the world because it is actual cash and can follow all existing cash laws.
* The easiest token to use.
* The most bankable token that supports a strong banking industry. 
* The most quantum safe token.
* The most inexpensive so users pay no fees. 
* The token with the most ability to mitigate the risk of theft and loss.
* The only token that provides accountability so that system administrators can’t steal without being noticed.
* The only token where users can send thousands of microtransactions like .0000001 without any fees or lag. 

## The raida-based will be the only stable token in the world that separates data from logic so that:  
* “smart contract” bugs are impossible.
* It is the first “crossover currency” and can go between reality and virtual reality.
* ”Turing complete” and usable by all computer programming languages.
* It can be stored in any datafile
* It can be transported using any transportation method. 
* It can be easily stored in a person’s mind where it is undetectable.  
* It can easily be integrated with existing ATM systems
* Built in KYC document storage that is ultra secure. 


## In addition, in the future,  the raida Protocol can be used to support: 
* Quantum safe key exchange systems to replace the SSL/TLS Protocols that are not quantum safe. 
* Quantum safe encrypted communications using any type of protocols such as HTTP, SMS, DNS, FTP.
* Compression of protocols like the ones above so they use less bandwidth and download much faster
* The striping and sharding of data so that it too has data supremacy. 
* The raida-based tokens can also be used as cryptographic keys, identifiers, and certificates. 
* Can hold state documents such as those dealing with Legislation, Regulation, Administration, Financial, Legal and Court Records, Licenses, Permits, Education, Health, Land, Property, Historical, PUblic Safety, Emergency Services and so much more. 


## TRUE CASH
Cash is a monetary system whereby the individual in physical possession of the money is considered its rightful owner. Cash uses people as self-symbolizing data. Credit is symbolized by placing numerical values on physical media, commonly coins made of metal, notes made of paper, fabric or plastic, and with raida-based tokens - files are stored on cell phones and USB drives.

In contrast, a leger system is where the possession of money is recorded on a table and this table is maintained by a different entity. Legers symbolize people using numbers or letters. Credit is also symbolized by numbers or letters. Here there is no self-symbolizing data as everything is abstract. 

Ledger Systems mix logic and data limiting their applications. Cash is pure data that simply needs to authenticate. This will allow the raida-based tokens to be developed quickly and inexpensivl. 

## Most Inovative
CloudCoin is the first and only true digital cash and was created as an experiment. Raida-based tokens  will be the first real use of this technology making it the most inovative Token in the world. The raida-based tokens will be protected by USPTO patent number [10,650,375](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10650375). So there will be no copy cats. The serverside code is not open source, further protecting agains immitators. This code took six years of R&D to create.  

## How It Works

### Raida-based tokens are files 

Suppose that I have a file called a CloudCoin. This file has a serial number and dozens of authenticity numbers in it. If I physically have the file, then I am the owner because I know the authenticity numbers. 

---

### Pass the file to make a purchase

If I want to buy something from you, I will give you the file. Now we both have the numbers. 


---


### Change the passwords to make it yours. 

Anyone with the numbers can change them by going to 25 servers located all around Wyoming. 
Once you have changed the numbers, the token is now yours because I no longer know the numbers and only you no the numbers. 

---

### The files are digital

This is how it works except it is all digital. All it required is a .5 second update of 25 databases in parallel. It is the fastest, most efficientt, easy to use monetary system in the world.

### What raida-based tokens actually look like

We don't actually need to see the serial numbers or authenticity numbers. One of the favorite ways of storing raida-based tokens is in .png files. Look at the image above. It is a .png file but it has many bytes of raida-based tokens information within it. PNG is a format that allows us to have custome "chunks" that will not be altered by other programs. If you download it and open it with a hex editor, you will see the serial numbers and authenticiy numbers of the coins. raida-based tokens can go into almost any file.

### Use Lockers:

The way we usally transfer money from one person to another is through the use of a RAIDA locker. People will put their coins in a safe locker on the RAIDA and then give another person the key. This reduces the amount of file handling that needs to happen. 

## Meaning of "RAIDA"
In 1985, the US government created a RAIDA (redundant array of independent DNS authorities), commonly called the "root servers" so that people could refer to computers by a name and not a number. 
Instead of us being required to type a number like “189.98.226.16” into a web browser, we can now simply type in something easier to remember like “www.wyoming.gov”. 
We all use this system thousands of times daily without even knowing it. 
The DNS RAIDA plays an essential role in keeping the Internet working. 
If the DNS RAIDA was to be hacked, it could bring down the entire Internet. The RAIDA has never gone down a minute since it was created in 1985. It has data supremacy and cannot be tampeted with. This system is scalable to the entire planet, is extremely fast and is free for everyone. 

The properties of the RAIDA can also be used to detect counterfeit tokens. We place one RAIDA node in different county juristictions. Each node is indepedently opperated so that there is no systemic risk of failure. 

## Conventions

### TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS (UDP/TCP)
The protocol supports both UDP and TCP. It is up to the client to decide which one. Generally, we have designed the requests so that they can fit into one 1400-byte packet so that these packet. 
As a rule, if you are going to need to send one packet then you should use UDP. If you are going to use more than 

### AUTHENTICITY NUMBERS
Autheticity Numbers are sixteeen bytes and are created by the Clients. Clients should use a different ANs for each RAIDA so there is no way that RAIDA Admins can know the ANs that are on other RAIDA. 

### FILES FORMAT
The format for the coins is a binary file format.

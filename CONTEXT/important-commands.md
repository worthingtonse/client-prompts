# Command Groups and Commands
Each request to the raida will cointain two bytes (index 4 and 5) that describe the command group code and a command code. 
The purpose of these is to tell the raida how to treat the request. 


## ESSENTIAL COMMAND CODES
Each command is made up of two bytes. The first byte is sometimes called the command group.

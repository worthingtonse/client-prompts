# Command Groups and Commands
Each request to the raida will cointain a command group code and a command code. The purpose of these is to tell the raida how to treat the request. 

## COMMAND GROUPS
The Command Group is a way of grouping commands that are simular in nature. This gives us the ability to have large amounts of commands. 
The Command Groups are numbered 0 to 255 and taken from byte 9 of the request header. 

Code | Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | Status | Status, Errors that have nothing to do with commands but usually with headers
1 | Authentication | Services that authenticate tokens.
2 | Healing | Services that make all RAIDA agree on the authenticity of tokens.
3 | Administration | Services that add or subtrack tokens from the raida.
4 | Key Exchange | Service that exchange cryptographic keys with other machines
5 | Banking | Services that store money for people
6 | Chat | Services that send commands through the raida
7 | Blockchain | Services that allow people to make changes to the raida blockchain
8 | Locker Services | Services that place and retrieve tokens from "RAIDA Lockers."
9 | Money Changing | Breaks 100s into 10s or joins 10s to make 100s. Works with all monetary denominations.
10 | Sharding | Allow people to move coins from one raida to another. 
11 | Swap | Services that allow people to change CloudCoin to Bitcoin or another currency
12 | RPC | Allows people to send command to other servers. 
13 | File System | Allows people to store files on the raida. 



## COMMAND CODES
Each Command Group has its own command code. However, in an attempt to make things less confusing, each command has a seperate command number. This will work
until we have more than 255 commands.

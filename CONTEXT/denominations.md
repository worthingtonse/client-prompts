# Denominations
Coins will have a one byte denomination number and then a four byte serial number. 
There are different types of denominations. Some are used for currencies. Currencies can generally be "broke" or "joined"
 into into each other like 10x100s can become 1x1000 and visa versa.

## CURRENCY BASED DENOMINATIONS
These are used for currency. The smallest one cannot be broken into anything smaller and the largest one cannot be joined into anything larger. 
These denominations are all multiples of 10 thus making them metric.

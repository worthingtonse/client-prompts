# **Function Specification: check\_duplicates() for CloudCoin File Management**

This document specifies the check\_duplicates() function, designed to manage CloudCoin files within a defined folder structure. The primary goal is to identify and segregate duplicate CloudCoin files from a "Suspect" folder into a "Duplicates" folder, preventing redundant storage across active CloudCoin directories.

## **Function Signature:**

function check\_duplicates(): string

* **Input Parameters:** This function takes the path to the parent folder as a parameter. This parameter is a string that will hold characters like forward slashes which may be escape characters. 
* **Return Value:**  
  * Returns the string "success" upon successful completion of all operations.  
  * Returns the string "failure" if any significant, unrecoverable error occurs during file or folder operations.

## **Folder Structure (Context):**

Assume the following folder structure exists, with all listed folders residing under a common parent directory:

* Suspect/: The primary source folder containing CloudCoin files that need to be checked for duplicates. These files contain 25 passwords and have serial numbers embedded in their filenames.  
* Bank/: A destination folder where CloudCoin files may reside.  
* Fracked/: A destination folder where CloudCoin files may reside.  
* Limbo/: A destination folder where CloudCoin files may reside.  
* Errored/: A destination folder where CloudCoin files may reside.  
* Encryption\_Failed/: A destination folder where CloudCoin files may reside.  
* Duplicates/: The target folder where identified duplicate files will be moved.

## **Detailed Logic:**

1. **Identify CloudCoin Files in Suspect Folder:**  
   * The function must iterate through every file within the Suspect/ folder.  
   * Assume that the unique identifier for a CloudCoin file is its serial number, which is part of its filename. The comparison of files should be based on these serial numbers/filenames.  
2. **Compare for Duplicates:**  
   * For each file F\_suspect found in the Suspect/ folder:  
     * Extract the serial number (or full filename as the identifier) from F\_suspect. The serial number is always follows the only pound sign in the name and ends with a space. So if the string "#4433 " is found in the name, the serial number is 4433.
     * Compare this identifier against the identifiers of all files present in the following "destination" folders: Bank/, Fracked/, Limbo/, Errored/, and Encryption\_Failed/.  
     * A file F\_suspect is considered a duplicate if another file with the *exact same serial number/filename* exists in *any* of these five destination folders.  
3. **Handle Duplicates (Move to Duplicates Folder):**  
   * If a file F\_suspect from Suspect/ is identified as a duplicate:  
     * **Move Operation:** The file F\_suspect must be moved from Suspect/ to the Duplicates/ folder.  
     * **Collision Resolution within Duplicates/:** Before moving, check if a file with the *exact same filename* (including extension) already exists within the Duplicates/ folder.  
       * If such a collision is detected, generate a random 4-letter lowercase alphanumeric string (e.g., "xyzw").  
       * Prepend this random string, followed by an underscore (\_), to the original filename of F\_suspect before moving it (e.g., xyzw\_originalfilename.extension).  
       * Then, proceed to move the file with its potentially modified name to Duplicates/.

## **Logging Requirements:**

* **Successful Moves:**  
  * For every file successfully moved to the Duplicates/ folder (including those with modified names), a log entry must be created.  
  * The log entry should clearly indicate the operation, the original file path, and the new file path/name.  
  * Example: LOG: Moved to Duplicates: /parent/Suspect/cloudcoin\_123.bin \-\> /parent/Duplicates/cloudcoin\_123.bin  
  * Example with rename: LOG: Moved to Duplicates: /parent/Suspect/cloudcoin\_456.bin \-\> /parent/Duplicates/abcd\_cloudcoin\_456.bin  
* **Error Logging:**  
  * All errors encountered during file system operations (e.g., inability to read directories, file not found, permission denied, failure to move file) must be logged.  
  * Error logs should be detailed, including the error type, a descriptive message, and the affected file/folder path.  
  * Example: ERROR: Could not access folder: /parent/Suspect/. Reason: Permission denied.  
  * Example: ERROR: Failed to move file: /parent/Suspect/test.bin to /parent/Duplicates/test.bin. Reason: Destination disk full.

## **Error Handling Philosophy:**

* The function should be robust against common file system issues.  
* Any error that prevents the function from performing its core logic (e.g., inability to list files in Suspect or any destination folder, critical file move failures) should cause the function to log the error and return "failure".  
* Minor, non-critical issues (e.g., a single file being inaccessible but the overall process can continue) should be logged as errors but might not necessarily lead to a "failure" return, depending on the implementation's robustness. However, for simplicity, assume any logged error could contribute to a "failure" return if it prevents the full logic from being executed as intended for all files.

## **General Considerations:**

* Efficiency: While not explicitly requested, consider efficient file system operations where possible (e.g., avoid reading entire file contents for comparison; filename/serial number comparison is key).

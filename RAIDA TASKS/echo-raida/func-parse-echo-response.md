# **Function Specification: parse_echo_response() for determining RAIDA server status**

This document specifies the parse_echo_response() function, which is responsible for parsing the binary response received from a single RAIDA server after an echo request has been sent and determining if the RAIDA server is online and functioning correctly.

## **Function Signature:**

function parse_echo_response(response_data: byte array, server_index: integer): Status | boolean

* **Input Parameters:**  
  * response_data (byte array): A byte array containing the UDP response packet from a RAIDA server.
  * server_index (integer): The index (0-24) of the RAIDA server that sent the response.
* **Return Value:**  
  * A status indicator for the corresponding RAIDA server (e.g., a boolean isOnline, or an enum value like Status.PASS or Status.FAIL).

## **Detailed Logic:**

### **1. Response Length Validation:**

* **Check Response Data:**
  * Validate that the received byte array (response_data) is not null.
  * Verify that the byte array has the expected length for a header-only response.
  * Refer to CONTEXT/response-header-format.md for the exact size requirements.
  * If the length is incorrect, treat the response as invalid and the RAIDA as offline.

### **2. Header Parsing:**

* **Deserialize Response Header:**
  * Parse the byte array into a response header object according to the structure defined in CONTEXT/response-header-format.md.
  * Extract all relevant fields from the header structure.

### **3. Status Code Examination:**

* **Check Status Field:**
  * Extract the status field from the parsed header.
  * Refer to CONTEXT/status-codes-from-raida.md for status code definitions.
  * **Status Code 1 (pass):** Indicates the RAIDA is online and healthy.
  * **Any other status code:** (e.g., 2 for fail, or any error codes) means the RAIDA is considered offline or has a problem.

## **Error Handling:**

* **Timeout Handling:**
  * If a response is not received before the timeout period, the RAIDA associated with that request is considered offline.

* **Malformed Response Handling:**
  * If the response is malformed (incorrect length, invalid structure), the RAIDA is considered offline.
  * If the status code is not 1 (pass), the RAIDA is considered offline.

## **Logging Requirements:**

* **Successful Operations:** Log successful parsing and status determination for each RAIDA server.
* **Error Logging:**  
  * Log timeout events with server index and timeout duration.
  * Log malformed response errors with server index and response details.
  * Log invalid status codes with server index and received status code.
  * Example: ERROR: RAIDA Server 5 response timeout after 5000ms.
  * Example: ERROR: RAIDA Server 12 returned invalid response length. Expected: 32 bytes, Received: 24 bytes.
  * Example: WARNING: RAIDA Server 8 returned status code 2 (fail). Server considered offline.

## **General Considerations:**

* **Performance:** Optimize parsing operations for speed, as this function may be called frequently.
* **Reliability:** Ensure robust error handling to prevent crashes from malformed or unexpected responses.
* **Thread Safety:** If used in a multi-threaded environment, ensure thread-safe operations.

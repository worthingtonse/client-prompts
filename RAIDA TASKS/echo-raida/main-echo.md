# echo

CLI ASYNC

Checks the health, status, and response times of all RAIDA servers by
sending echo requests.

C:\echo.exe or just echo

## Description

The \`/echo\` endpoint provides a simple way to verify the operational
status of the entire RAIDA network. It\'s a fundamental utility for
developers to test network connectivity and RAIDA health before
attempting more complex operations. Since this is an asynchronous call,
it initiates a task and returns a task ID immediately, which you can
then use to poll for the result.


ðŸ’¡ Why use /echo?

Before executing critical transactions like sending or receiving
CloudCoins, you can use this endpoint to get a real-time snapshot of the
network\'s health. This allows your application to gracefully handle
potential network issues and provide better feedback to the end-user.

## Asynchronous Workflow

#### Understanding Asynchronous API Calls

This endpoint is asynchronous, which means:

1.  When you call this endpoint, it **immediately returns a task ID**.
2.  You then need to **periodically check the task status** using the
    `/api/v1/task/{task_id}` endpoint.
3.  Once the task is complete, the task status endpoint will return the
    full results in the \`data\` field.
## Parameters

This endpoint does not require any parameters.

## Response

When the asynchronous task completes, the \`data\` field of the task
status response will contain the \`EchoResponse\` object with the
following properties.


#### Response Properties


online integer


The total number of RAIDA servers that are online and responded
successfully.

pownstring  string

A 25-character string representing the pass/fail status for each RAIDA
server. \'p\' indicates a pass, and \'f\' indicates a fail.

pownarray array\<integer\>

An array of 25 integers where \`1\` indicates a pass (online) and \`0\`
indicates a fail (offline or error).

latencies array\<integer\>

An array of 25 integers, where each value is the response time in
milliseconds for the corresponding RAIDA server.

This JSON response object will also be written to the file named last-echo-log.json        

That is found in CloudCoin/Pro/last-echo-log.json

## Function: Echo Special Logging

### Objective

This function is responsible for displaying the results of the `echo-raida` command to the user in the console. The output should be a clear, visual representation of the health of the entire RAIDA network.

### Input

* An array or list of 25 status indicators, one for each RAIDA server (e.g., an array of booleans or enums from the `Parse Echo Response` step).

### Logic

1. **Iterate Through RAIDA Statuses:**

   * Loop through the status array from RAIDA 0 to RAIDA 24.

2. **Format the Output:**

   * For each RAIDA, print its index followed by its status.

   * Use clear, human-readable terms like "Online" or "Offline", "Pass" or "Fail".

   * To improve readability, display the results in 5 rows of 5 columns.

### Required Console Output Format

The console output **must** match the following structure exactly:

```
RAIDA Status Check:
0:Pass   1:Pass   2:Pass   3:Pass   4:Pass
5:Pass   6:Fail   7:Pass   8:Pass   9:Pass
10:Pass  11:Pass  12:Pass  13:Pass  14:Pass
15:Pass  16:Pass  17:Pass  18:Pass  19:Pass
20:Pass  21:Pass  22:Pass  23:Pass  24:Pass

RAIDA Health: 24/25 Online.

```

* A summary line showing the total number of online servers must be displayed at the end.

# **Function Specification: create\_get\_ticket\_requests()**

This document specifies the create\_get\_ticket\_requests() function. This function is responsible for creating a batch of requests to be sent to RAIDA servers to obtain "tickets" as proof of authenticity for a set of tokens.

## **Core Concepts:**

* **RAIDA (Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents):** A decentralized network of 25 servers.  
* **Ticket:** A 4-byte random number provided by a RAIDA server as temporary, verifiable proof that a token was authentic at the time of the request. Tickets are used in the healing process for "fractured" tokens.  
* **AN (Authenticity Number):** The token's 16-byte password.

## **Function Signature:**

function create\_get\_ticket\_requests(tokens\_to\_check: array of {denomination: byte, serial\_number: uint32, an: byte\_array}, challenge\_bytes: array of 16-byte arrays): Array\<byte\[\]\> | string

* **Input Parameters:**  
  * tokens\_to\_check (array of objects): An array of tokens for which to get tickets. Each object contains:  
    * denomination (byte): The denomination of the token.  
    * serial\_number (uint32): The 4-byte serial number of the token.  
    * an (16-byte array): The Authenticity Number to be checked.  
  * challenge\_bytes (array of 16-byte arrays): An array containing 25 unique 16-byte challenges. The challenge at index i will be used in the request for RAIDA server i.  
* **Return Value:**  
  * An array of 25 complete, prepared byte arrays. Each byte array represents a full request intended for one of the 25 servers.  
  * Returns the string "failure" if any significant, unrecoverable error occurs.

## **Request Structure Overview:**

Each "get ticket" request consists of three main parts, concatenated in order:

1. **Request Header (32 bytes):** Contains metadata, including the target server ID and the command.  
2. **Request Body (variable length):** Contains the challenge and the list of tokens to be checked.  
3. **Termination Bytes (2 bytes):** A fixed sequence (0x3E 0x3E) to mark the end of the request.

## **Detailed Logic:**

The function will construct 25 distinct requests, one for each potential target server (Server ID 0 to 24).

### **1\. Request Body Construction (variable length):**

* Let N be the number of tokens in the tokens\_to\_check array.  
* The size of the data for one token is 1 (denomination) \+ 4 (serial\_number) \+ 16 (AN) \= 21 bytes.  
* The total body length will be 16 (challenge) \+ (N \* 21\) bytes.  
* For each of the 25 servers, the body is constructed by concatenating the following parts in order:  
  * **Challenge (16 bytes):** The corresponding 16-byte challenge from the challenge\_bytes input array for that server.  
  * **Tokens to Check (N \* 21 bytes):** Iterate through the tokens\_to\_check array. For each token, append its 1-byte denomination, 4-byte serial\_number, and 16-byte an.

### **2\. Request Header Construction (32 bytes):**

Create a 32-byte header for each of the 25 servers. This function assumes **Encryption Type 0 (No Encryption)**.

* **Bytes 0-3:**  
  * Byte 0 (VR): 0x00  
  * Byte 1 (SP): 0x00  
  * Byte 2 (RI): **Server ID** (from 0x00 for server 0, up to 0x18 for server 24\)  
  * Byte 3 (SH): 0x00  
* **Bytes 4-5 (Command):**  
  * Byte 4 (CG): 0x02 (Command Group: Healing)  
  * Byte 5 (CM): 0x28 (Command: Get Ticket, which is 40 in decimal)  
* **Bytes 6-15:** All set to 0x00.  
* **Byte 16 (EN):** 0x00 (Encryption Type: No Encryption).  
* **Bytes 17-21:** All set to 0x00.  
* **Bytes 22-23 (BL):** The length of the body plus two termination bytes. This will be (16 \+ (N \* 21)) \+ 2 \= 18 \+ (N \* 21). This value is represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer (big-endian).  
* **Bytes 24-29:** All set to 0x00.  
* **Bytes 30-31 (Echo):** Two randomly generated bytes.

### **3\. Termination Bytes:**

* After the header and body, append two fixed termination bytes: 0x3E 0x3E.

### **4\. Final Request Assembly:**

* For each of the 25 servers, concatenate the constructed Header, its corresponding Body, and the Termination Bytes into a single byte array.  
* Return the array containing all 25 complete request byte arrays.

## **Logging and Error Handling:**

* **Success:** Log key milestones, such as the start of the function and its successful completion.  
* **Errors:** Log any errors encountered during the process (e.g., invalid input parameters). Any error that prevents the successful creation of all 25 requests should cause the function to log the error and return the string "failure".

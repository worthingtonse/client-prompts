### **Project Title: Dynamic Timeout Prediction for Parallel UDP Requests**

#### **1\. Project Goal**

You are to build a machine learning pipeline in Python that predicts the optimal timeout for a batch of 25 parallel UDP requests. The goal is to minimize user-perceived latency by setting a timeout that is just long enough to collect a target number of responses, without waiting unnecessarily for slow or non-responsive servers.

#### **2\. Problem Context**

* A client application sends a request to 25 servers simultaneously over UDP.  
* Due to the nature of UDP, packets can be lost, and some servers may never respond.  
* The application must collect responses from a subset of these servers before proceeding.  
* The key is to dynamically calculate a timeout for each batch of requests, rather than using a static, hard-coded value.

#### **3\. Core Logic & Success Criterion**

* A configurable parameter, required\_responses, will define how many servers must respond.  
* Given 25 total servers, the timeout should be set to the predicted time it takes for the required\_responses-th server to reply.  
* For example, if required\_responses \= 23, the system should stop waiting as soon as 23 servers have responded. The model's job is to predict how long that will take from the moment the requests are sent.

#### **4\. Proposed Solution: Supervised Regression Model**

The best approach for this problem is to build a regression model that predicts the response time for a *single server*. We will then use this model to predict the response time for all 25 servers in a batch and derive the final timeout from those predictions.

**Prediction Workflow:**

1. When a new batch of 25 requests is to be sent, create a feature vector for each of the 25 server requests.  
2. Use the trained regression model to generate 25 individual response time predictions (one for each server).  
3. Sort these 25 predicted times in ascending order.  
4. The final timeout for the batch is the value at index required\_responses \- 1 in the sorted list.

Recommended Algorithm:  
A Gradient Boosting Regressor (like LightGBM or XGBoost) is highly recommended. These models are state-of-the-art for tabular data, are robust to different feature types, and can capture complex interactions between variables.

#### **5\. Dataset & Feature Engineering**

The model will be trained on a historical dataset of requests, provided in a CSV file named request\_history.csv.

**5.1. Raw Data Columns (Renamed for Clarity):**

| Column Header | Description | Data Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| server\_id | The unique identifier for the server. | Categorical (0-24) |
| request\_timestamp | The Unix epoch timestamp (in milliseconds) when the request was sent. | Integer |
| timed\_out | A binary flag indicating if this specific request timed out. 1 for yes, 0 for no. | Binary |
| request\_size\_bytes | The size of the request payload sent to the server. | Integer |
| server\_processing\_time\_ns | The execution time in nanoseconds, as reported by the server itself. | Integer |
| response\_time\_ms | **(Target Variable)** The time in milliseconds from sending the request to receiving the response. For rows where timed\_out \= 1, this will be null/empty. | Integer |

**5.2. Suggested Feature Engineering (Crucial for Performance):**

To improve the model's predictive power, you must generate new features from the raw data. These should be calculated for each server\_id:

* **Time-Based Features:**  
  * hour\_of\_day: Extract from request\_timestamp. Network conditions vary by time of day.  
  * day\_of\_week: Extract from request\_timestamp. Weekly patterns can exist.  
* **Historical Performance Features (Rolling Windows):**  
  * server\_avg\_response\_time\_1h: The server's average response\_time\_ms over the last hour.  
  * server\_avg\_response\_time\_24h: The server's average response\_time\_ms over the last 24 hours.  
  * server\_timeout\_rate\_1h: The server's timed\_out rate (as a percentage) over the last hour.  
  * server\_timeout\_rate\_24h: The server's timed\_out rate over the last 24 hours.  
  * server\_avg\_processing\_time\_1h: The server's average server\_processing\_time\_ns over the last hour.  
* **Static Server Features (if available):**  
  * If possible, add a separate file or configuration that maps server\_id to static data like its **geographic region** or **base ping time**. This provides a strong baseline for latency.

#### **6\. Implementation Plan**

Please generate a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the request\_history.csv file using pandas.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   * Handle missing values in response\_time\_ms (these are the timed-out requests and cannot be used for training the target variable, but their features are still useful).  
   * Convert request\_timestamp to a datetime object to facilitate feature extraction.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Implement functions to calculate the suggested features above.  
4. **Model Training:**  
   * Instantiate a lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.  
   * Split the data into a training set and a validation set (e.g., using the most recent data for validation).  
   * Train the model on the training set.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Report the model's performance on the validation set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
6. **Prediction Function:** Create a function predict\_batch\_timeout(batch\_features, model, required\_responses) that takes the features for the 25 new requests, uses the trained model to generate 25 predictions, and returns the final calculated timeout value as described in Section 4\.  
7. **Save the Model:** Save the trained model and the feature engineering logic (e.g., using joblib or pickle) so it can be loaded and used for live predictions without retraining.

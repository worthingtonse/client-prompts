There are many resources that can be kept on the raida. These include: 
1. Coins
2. Data objects
3. Routing
4. Apps
5. IDs

People need to find the resources and know that they are the true location fo the resource. 

# Requirments

1. Resources will need to be created.
2. Everyone in the world should know about the existance of resources that are open, such as coins.
3. The

# Creating a new single RAIDA Server. 
1. Everyone should know about its existance
2. Everyone should know its IP and port address
3. It should be able to authenticate itself with anyone
4. It should be able to destroy its self.
5. Perhaps it can be destoryed and then fixed.

# Some ideas
Each of the twenty five existing RAIDA can have "Shards", "Clouds" or "Splits" or children that it handles independently. 



Every coin has a Shard byte and a Split Byte. We would use the shard. 

They are all set to zero now. 

Useing the Swap 

Person sends 1000 CC to one raida. Can then register that one RAIDA

--R21 Shard 0 --> R21 shard 1. Shard 0 tracks the IP addresses of all the other Shards. 

--R21 has a list of all the coins and on what shard they are on. Maybe a blockchain of allthe shard changes?

New service that allows people to look up the location of a coin. What shard is it on.

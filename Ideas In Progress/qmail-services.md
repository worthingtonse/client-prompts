# QMail Services
This coveres the actual servics used by Qmail starting with Phase I

## Note about Compact Binary Document Format
Many of the QMail services use the the CBDF to reduce the size of the request to its minium. Requests may include other CBDF files within them. Here are the 
specifications of the CBDF: 

** Directory CBDF File Format **
| Field                     | Size (Bytes) | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Fields     | Depends on CBDF File   | This is a header that contains all the fields that are not optional and have a fixed length  |
| Number of Key-Value Pairs | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) indicating the number of key-value pairs that follow. |
| Key-Value Pair(s)         | Variable     | Repeated for each pair (as specified by Number of Key-Value Pairs):         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Key           | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) representing a predefined key (e.g., 0 = "name").  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value Length  | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) specifying the length of the value in bytes.       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value         | 0–255        | Binary data for the value (length as specified by Value Length).            |



### Send Mail/Attachment CBDF
Note that each file that is uploaded must have the same GUID but a different File Type/Index

Name | Bytes | Description
---|---|---
Email's GUID | 16 | A unique number randomly generated by the client and used for all raida mail servers for the same email. This number is put on the email file and all subsequent attachment files
File Type/index | 1 | 0 if it is an email file. 1 = first attachment and up as more files are added. There  
First Receiver ID | 6 | 2 byte for coin ID, 1 Denomination, 4 Serial Number. Coin ID will be 0x0006 for Phase I. 
RAID Type | 1 | 0 = Stripe, 1 = Mirror, 5 = Stripe with Parity, 6 = Stripe with Vertical Parity, Stripe with Horizontal Parity, 7 = Striped with Horizontal and Vertical Parity, 8 = Striped with Horizontal, Vertical and Diagnal Parity, 10 = Mirroed stripes
Stripe Number | 1 | A number 0 to N (up to 32 servers)
Of Number |1 | Such as "7" of "25" Where 25 is the Of Number


Send Mail Resource Table
ID | Field Name | Example | Description
---|---|---|---
1 | To | 00 06 12 45 43 A4 00 06 12 D3 35 02 | Seven bytes each. Coin type 0x0006, Denomination, 4 byte serial number. 
2 | CCs | 00 06 12 09 73 A4 00 06 12 09 73 A4  | Seven bytes each. Coin type 0x0006, Denomination, 4 byte serial number. 
3 | BCCs | 00 06 12 09 73 A4  | Seven bytes each. Coin type 0x0006, Denomination, 4 byte serial number. 
4 | Subject Stripe | 05 DE 23 | Raid type, Stripe Number, 'Of Number' all remaining bytes (253) can be used for the subject. 
5 | Shuffle Table Shard 1 | A square of the Of Number. If there are 16 servers, the shuffle table will be 16 x 16 or 256 bytes. This is the first 8 rows.  The numbers in each cell will be represented by five bits. See table below. | PHASE II
6 | Shuffle Table Shard 2 | Like above. This is the Second 8 rows. | PHASE II
7 | Shuffle Table Shard 3 | Like above. This is the Second 8 rows. | PHASE II

STATUS_SUCCESS = 250
ERROR_FEW_COINS_IN_LOCKER = 153,
ERROR_LOCKER_EMPTY_OR_NOT_EXISTS = 179,
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER = 198,

## Update Directory Phase I
Not the Update Directory is also used to create a new record and delete existing ones. When this is called, if there is no existing record, it will be created. If this is called and the information is left blank, the Raida server will delete the record. 
This uploads information into the DRD (Distributed Resource Directory). Every Raida server has a compy of the directory so this is uploaded 25 different times. 
It is a whole file designed so everyone can see it. However, it does allow for some permissions based on the two built-in user groups (White List and Black list)

** Permission Groups **
* White List can see everything.
* Blacklist can see nothing.


The updating the direcotry can be complicated so we use the Compact Binary Document Format within the body of the request. 
This request body should be encrypted because it will include a CloudCoin (in a locker code) to pay the Directory Raida. 
By default, it costs one CloudCoin to create, update, read or delete from the directory.

### CBDF Key Table Version 0
This is for phase I. There is a much larger list available for phase II.

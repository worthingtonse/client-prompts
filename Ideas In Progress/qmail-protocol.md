# QMail Protocol
The QMail protocol is designed to replace the existing email system. 


## Phase I Work Plan: 
**Functiosn:**

1. Find Email Server
2. Pay for email server
3. Find directory of users
4. Post my info in director
5. Search user directory
6. Encrypt email
7. Send email
8. check for new emails
9. Marketing


## Finding the Email Servers
Each raida will have an identical copy of all the email servers. This will be a file in the  public folder. They users will call the GET_OBJECT raidax command and specify the email server file. The email server file will will not be encrypted. The user only has to call it from one server. The Raid type will be NULL raid. 


The binary file consists of concatenated records, each representing a user's data. Below is the format for a single record, described in a table. All integers are (big-endian).

| Field                     | Size (Bytes) | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server ID                   | 5            | Unique identifier for the user (binary-encoded, fixed length).              |
| Percentage take           | 6            | Unsigned integer  % Server takes of payment in Satoshi. (Lik |
| Number of Key-Value Pairs | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) indicating the number of key-value pairs that follow. |
| Key-Value Pair(s)         | Variable     | Repeated for each pair (as specified by Number of Key-Value Pairs):         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Key           | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) representing a predefined key (e.g., 0 = "name").  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value Length  | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) specifying the length of the value in bytes.       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value         | 0–255        | Binary data for the value (length as specified by Value Length).            |


The user can also download the code word files that will change the bytes into Titles, Adjitives and Plural Nouns. 

## Pay For Email Severs
There will need to be a "Pay" service. This service will accept a coin, authenticate it, and then credit a table called the credits table. This table will be located on the hard drive. There will be 16 different folders for each denominations. These folders will each have 256 subfolders named hexidecimal from 00 to FF. Each folder will have 

A row of this data requires a minimum of 11 bytes: 5 bytes for the user ID and 6 bytes for the credit amount (stored as an unsigned integer representing the number of smallest units, such as Satoshis, to avoid floating-point precision issues.

To efficiently support fast lookups and updates by user ID for potentially many users, use a hash table (also known as a hash map or dictionary, depending on the programming language). The 5-byte user ID serves as the key, and the credit amount serves as the value.

## Find Direcotry of Users
For Phase one, this will be like a host file that the user will download from the raida in a simular manner to how the Email Server file is downloaded. This
file will be whole and unencrypted on all the RAIDA unless it gets too big. This file will be binary and require at least 12 bytes per person. 

The format for this file will be one row per user and in comma seperated vlues. Here is how each row will be seperated:
Binary File Format Specification
The binary file consists of concatenated records, each representing a user's data. Below is the format for a single record, described in a table.

### Binary User Lookup File Format Specification

The binary file consists of concatenated records, each representing a user's data. Below is the format for a single record, described in a table.

| Field                     | Size (Bytes) | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User ID                   | 5            | Unique identifier for the user (binary-encoded, fixed length).              |
| Satoshi Amount            | 6            | Unsigned integer (big-endian). Amount the sender must pay to send in Satoshi. |
| Number of Key-Value Pairs | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) indicating the number of key-value pairs that follow. |
| Key-Value Pair(s)         | Variable     | Repeated for each pair (as specified by Number of Key-Value Pairs):         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Key           | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) representing a predefined key (e.g., 0 = "name").  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value Length  | 1            | Unsigned integer (0–255) specifying the length of the value in bytes.       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Value         | 0–255        | Binary data for the value (length as specified by Value Length).            |

**Notes:**
- Records are concatenated without separators; the file ends at the last record.
- Keys are predefined and mapped to indices (0–255) in the application (e.g., 0 = "name", 1 = "phone").
- Values can contain any binary data, including null bytes (0x00), as they are length-prefixed.
- Total record size: 12 bytes (fixed) + (2 + value_length) bytes per key-value pair.
- Example record with 2 pairs (e.g., `name=jim`, `phone=22323`):
  - User ID: 5 bytes (e.g., `0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05`).
  - Satoshi: 6 bytes (e.g., `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x27 0x10` for 10000 Satoshis).
  - Pair count: 1 byte (`0x02`).
  - Pair 1: Key `0x00` (1 byte), Length `0x03` (1 byte), Value `0x6A 0x69 0x6D` (3 bytes, "jim").
  - Pair 2: Key `0x01` (1 byte), Length `0x05` (1 byte), Value `0x32 0x32 0x33 0x32 0x33` (5 bytes, "22323").
  - Total: 24 bytes.

## Posting Info To the Directory
To begin with, users will only be able to post: 
1. Display Name
2. Discription
3. Price
4. White List
5. Blacklist
6. My Email Servers
   
## Search user directory
The client will download the file as above and that can be searched. 

## Format and Encrypt Email
No formatting encryption for phase one. But, there should be some meta data in the email saying the encryption type is zero
See the meta data file. However, there must be some heading for a text file. 

This will use the (Compact Binary Document Format)[https://github.com/worthingtonse/client-prompts/main/Ideas In Progress/compact-binary-document-format.md]


## Send email

Send Meta Data and striped file to Raida useing the stiping format
Nee
### Meta Data Needed For Emails
1. Encryption Type
2. Raid Type
3. Number of servers used
4. CCR Check if the message has been tampered with
5. Compression type
6. Expiration Date
7. Allowed to be viewed by (array of user IDs). Deletes after that.



## Call One Random RAIDA to Checkcheck for new emails
This protocol may already be created in the chat software 

# Marketing
1. Email Marketing site
2. Sell Account Page (buy certificates)
3. Email server rules
4. Email server software sales site.

## RAIDA Mail Folder Structure
The all-folders folder holds all the user and public files. 

Each user is identified by a five byte identifier. Each user has a folder in the private folders that is based on their identifier. The user-folder folder has 256 sub folders
named after the first hexidecimal characters in the users ID. Then, there are four levels of subfolders so that the leaf folders are five folders deep. 

Each user has some standard folders. The user can create any folders that they want but there will always be a Mail folder. 
Within the mail folder there are two types of files, file stipes (.bin) and pointers (.lnk) to file stripes that are located in the public-files. 

```
00
--Mail
----c10d92f83091496d893f8e20f30372ea.0.bin // First Version of the file. 
----c10d92f83091496d893f8e20f30372ea.1.bin // File 0 after it haws been changed. 
----c10d92f83091496d893f8e20f30372ea.2.bin
----.c10d92f83091496d893f8e20f30372ea.3.bin // File after it has been deleted (has a . infont of it. Users can still see deleted files and undelete them)
----e08b3a6835c34716bad5bfe5a6d556cc.lnk // Link to a public file. 

```

## File Nameing convention. 
The file name is composed of two parts:
1. The 1 byte hexidencimal charactger identifier (Random and the same on all 
1. The 8 hexidencimal charactger identifier (Random and the same on all 
1. The 16 hexidecimal character Metadata name.
2. The 16 hexidecimal character shuffling order identifiers. These are used to encrypt the message. 

### The common name is added with the other bytes from other 

This part is returned by the "List Mail Names" service. All the names are added together to create 128 bytes. These bytes can converted into UTF-8. 

Files have a GUID for a name.

```tree
all-folders
--public-folders
----00
------00
--user-folders
----00
----01
----02
----03
----00

```
